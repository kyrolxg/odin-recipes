      This creamy garlic shrimp pasta is the perfect combination of rich flavor
      and simple ingredients. Juicy shrimp are sautéed in butter, garlic, and
      herbs, then tossed with al dente pasta and a smooth, cheesy cream sauce.
      Whether you're cooking for a cozy dinner or impressing guests, this
      one-pan dish is quick to make and full of restaurant-style flavor — all
      from your own kitchen!

      <li>¼ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
      <li>⅓ cup chopped fresh dill</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Salad:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (12 ounce) package small pasta shells</li>
      <li>1 pound cooked, peeled, and deveined small shrimp - cut in half</li>
      <li>½ cup finely diced red bell pepper</li>
      <li>¾ cup diced celery</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 pinch paprika, for garnish</li>
      <li>3 sprigs fresh dill, or as desired</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk 1 ¼ cups mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce,
        salt, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl; add lemon juice and 1/3 cup
        chopped dill. Whisk until thoroughly combined; keep refrigerated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a pot of well-salted water to a boil and stir in pasta shells;
        cook until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water to
        cool pasta slightly; drain again. Transfer to a large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Toss shrimp with pasta; add red bell pepper, celery, and dressing to
        pasta mixture. Mix thoroughly to coat and fill shells with dressing.
        Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, 2 to 3
        hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir salad again before serving and season to taste with more salt,
        black pepper, lemon juice, and cayenne pepper if desired. If salad seems
        a little dry, mix in a little more mayonnaise. Garnish with paprika and
        sprigs of dill.
