    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>Vanilla</li>
      <li>Baking Soda</li>

      <li>Flour</li>
      <li>Chocolate Chips</li>
      <li>Nuts(Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Beat the butter and sugars, then beat in the eggs and vanilla.</li>
      <li>Dissolve the baking soda in hot water and add to the mixture.</li>
      <li>Stir in the flour, chocolate chips, and walnuts.</li>
      <li>Drop dough onto a prepared baking sheet.</li>
      <li>
        In an oven preheated to 350 degrees F, the chocolate chip cookies should
        be perfectly baked in about 10 minutes. The edges should be golden brown
        and the cookies should be mostly set (they'll continue to set as the
        cool).
